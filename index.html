            This page was created using purely html and css. (Minus this modal which does not need to be re-created.)<br />I challenge you to re-create it! It will work all of the basic html and css skills, from absolutes, to z-index, this is a great project to start with and make your own!
          </p>
          <p>
            So open up your developer tools (ctrl-i/command-i), and get started!
